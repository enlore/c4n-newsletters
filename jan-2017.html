<p> Hey everybody. Happy holidays! </p>

<p> You've probably already gotten an auto email about details for the Jan
    3rd meetup changing. Sorry for the spam vibe, but this is a more general
    email about our whole series of First Tuesday of the Month meetups
    changing plus our plans for the rest of the year.

<h2> Code for Nashville, Now with More Iron Yard and Hackathons </h2>

<p>
    We've moved to Iron Yard on a more permanent basis and doubled our RSVP
    limit. This means:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Free parking (don't' park at the City Winery)</li>
    <li>More space (come hang out)</li>
    <li>More people (come meet them)</li>
</ul>

<p> We owe a big thanks to Eventbrite for hosting us for so long, and we look
    forward to fostering more creative partnership in the new year. Thanks!
</p>

<p> We're gearing up for an exciting 2017. Here are some of the interesting
    things we have in the works.
</p>

<h3> Storytelling and Government Data, a Hackathon </h3>
<em> Public Health Data Visualizations, Mappler, and You </em>

<p> All day, March 18th, 2017
    <br />
    The Nashville Software School
</p>

<p> Working title. We're partnering with Metro Nashville and Dr. Wansoo Im, a public health
    researcher working at Meharry Medical College. As some of you know, Dr. Im recently
    gave a compelling presentation at our November meetup about this Mappler product.
    Mappler makes creating rich, data infused maps very straightforward, and we'd
    like to work with him to leverage this tool in our civic, volunteer efforts.</p>

<p> So in March we're going to get together and see what kind of interesting things
    we can make. We're also going to be hosting two workshops, one at the beginning
    of February and one at the beginning of March. Dr. Im will teach attendees
    to use Mappler (so easy middele schoolers can do it, or so I've been told),
    and we'll have a guided tour of some of the more interesting datasets available
    to us to use. More details on the workshops to come. </p>

<h3> The MC Legal Hackathon </h3>
<em> A hackathon with our friends, the Music City Legal Hackers </em>

<p> April 7 and 8, 2017
    <br />
    Vanderbilt Law School
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.mclegalhackathon.org/">http://www.mclegalhackathon.org/</a>
</p>

<p> Our sister organization, the Music City Legal Hackers, is throwing their
    very first hackathon here in Nashville, and it's going to be pretty good. (I know
    so, since I'm on the planning board and will be there to help run it.)
</p>

<p> Their focus is, broadly, bringing tech powers to the legal industry which
    is great. The legal industry needs it. We're very excited to collaborate
    with them on this, and I want to invite you show up in full force. It's
    going to be a very fun and productive event, I think. See their site for
    more details.
</p>


<h3> Our Regular Hackathon in June </h3>
<em> As of yet unnamed. </em>

<p> Early June, 2017 </p>

<p> We're going to start putting this together come the first of the year, so
    expect to hear more about it! As ever, if you have a project proposal or
    know someone that does, have them email me at
    <a href="mailto:n.e.lorenson@gmail.com">n.e.lorenson@gmail.com</a>
    or <a href="mailto:nick@codefornashville.org">nick@codefornashville.org</a>.
</p>

<p> On that note, we're also going to start in on our 2017 fund raising efforts
    (wherein we beg everyone for money, pls) so if you know of any
    organizations that would like to donate to C4N to keep it running, buy food
    and stuff for our meetups, or sponsor one of our events, do get in touch.
</p>

<h3> Lastly, Notes From Your Organizers </h3>

<em> Nick <a href="mailto:nick@codefornashville.org">nick@codefornashville.org</a></em>
<p> This has been a very interesting year. Taking on the responsibility of organizer
    has been a lot of work and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. 2017 is going to be
    good, as we've begun to build a great relationship with the city and are working
    to continue to build a community around what we're trying to do as a group.
</p>
<p>
    All that being said, we have plenty of work cut out for us. The city is working
    hard to modernize, and we know we can be good partners in those efforts.
</p>
<p>
    We're here to run this for us, you, and the residents of the city (which
    are all the same group, you know?). Jump in, ask questions, don't be afraid
    to mix it up. Reach out any time on Slack or via email. Thank you!
